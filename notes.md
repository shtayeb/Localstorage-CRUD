# Refactoring UI

    ## Start with designing a feature, not a layout

    ## Details comes later
        ### Hold the color, resist the temptation to introduce color right away
            > - start by designing in gray scale - by doing that you will use spacing,contrast and size


    ## Dont design too much
        > - You dont need to design every single feature to move on to implementation

    ## Work in cycles
        > - start by designing a simple version of a feature and implement it

    ## Choose a personality
        > - eg: A banking site communicates secure and professional
        > - eg: A startup site communicates fun and playful

        ### Personality depends of these factors
            #### Font Choice
                > - elegant and classic - serif
                > - playful look - rounded serif
            #### Color
                > - safe and familiar - Blue
                > - expensive and sophisticated - Gold
            #### Border Radius
                > - A small border radius is Neutral
                > - A large border redius feel more playful
                > - No border radius feels more serious
                > - stay consistent , dont mix rounded and square in a single interface
            #### Language
                > - professional and friendlier tone

            #### Deciding what you actually want
                > - Look into competitors

    ## Limit your choices
        ### Define systems in advance
            > - Color shades
            > - sizes
        ### Designing by process of elimination
            > - side by side comparision of your available sizes and colors
        ### Systemize Everything
            > - Font size
            > - Font weight
            > - Line Height
            > - Color
            > - margin
            > - padding
            > - width
            > - Height
            > - box Shadow
            > - border redius
            > - border width
            > - opacity
    ## Hierarchy is Everything
        > - how important an element appears

        ### Size isnt everything
            > - dont rely on size to control hierarchy

            #### Try to stick with two or three colors
                > - A dark color for primary content
                > - A gray for secondary content
                > - A lighter gray for tertiary content
            ## font
                > - A normal font weight (400, 500) depends on font
                > - A heaview font for (600, 700) depends on font

                > - Stay away from weights under 400
        ### Dont use gray text on colored backgrounds
            > - instead use the same color with lighter and less saturation
        ### Emphasize by de-emphasizing
        ### Labels are a last resort
        ### Combine labels and values
        ### Labels are secondary

    ## separate visual heirarchy from document hierarchy
        ### balance weight and contrast
        ### semantics are secondary
            > - Primary actions should be obvious - solid, high contrast background
            > - Secondary actions should be clear but not prominent
            > - Tertiary actions should be discoverable but unobtrosive


    ## Layout and Spacing
        ### start with too much white space

    ## Establish a spacing and sizing system
        > - font base 16px and go up with multiples

    ## You dont have to fill the whole screen
        ### Thinking in column
